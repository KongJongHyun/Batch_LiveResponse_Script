# *Live Response Batch Script*

***LR script*** is short for ***Live Response Scripts***, which is a method for collecting and analyzing volatile information before copying images of the author's media.  Volatile information includes ***system time***, ***network Connection information***, ***logon user information***, ***running process information***, and more.  This information should be collected first because it is volatile information that evaporates after the computer is turned off.  It is a way of collecting and analyzing all the information that can be collected from the system that was alive.
